# Sorting-Competiton-using-signal


The father creates two children and waits for them.
Each child needs to sort an array. The first child needs to sort by bubble sort and the second child by insertion sort. When the child finishes he sends signal(SIGUSE1,SIGUSER2 in respectively) to the father and the father prints the number of process that sent the signal.

Assumptions - The kids go out at the same time .
